- Reinforcing Knowledge is one of the most important things that you can do to learn
- How the game actually work:
        - We roll a dice
        - Whenever we get a one we lose all current points, this is why we might need to hold our points
        - The first player to get 100 points wins the game
- There is another method of selecting elements elements by their ids
- Get elementByID is faster
